Please strictly follow the requirements below to generate the egov framework based on Spring Boot using event storming metadata:

1. First, create the package structure according to package.structure.md
2. Files in each folder must be created based on the metadata, and you should not create anything that is not referenced in the metadata.
3. For domain, service, infrastructure, and mapper implementation, refer to model-implementation-rules.md, layer-generation-rules.md, and mapper-generation-rules.md
4. All annotations and imports used in generated files must be included without omission to ensure no errors occur.
5. After all files have been generated, be sure to verify that there are no issues with execution.
